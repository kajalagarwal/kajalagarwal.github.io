    <h3>Reflection</h3>
     <p>For us working together was a fun and light experience. Since it was our first pairing session I felt a little disoriented and having an instructor kind of watching over us also affected me, but Kajal and I worked through it. We tried to communicate our ideas with one another and were happy in the end with the structure and design of our page. Overall we worked well as partners.</p>
