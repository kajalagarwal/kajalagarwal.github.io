<h2>Environment</h2>
<p>With peer pairing you have both positive and negative effects. While working toward the problem you have some one to help you out but also someone whose ideas and thoughts you should value.</p>
<p>Working with peer was helpful to me in a way because I got different ideas and approaches to solve a problem which you think you have seen but have not worked </p>
<p>But also sometimes it is frustrating because you can not share each of your thoughts during working which makes the flow of working down and you end up with nothing or say only with your own ideas.</p>
<h2>Feedback Recieved</h2>
<p>Feedback I recieved was very generous and helpful to me to understand where I am lacking towards pairing and what can I do to improve. </p> 
<p>Some of the areas I am lacking is making my ideas understandable to other person which is very important during pairing and I will work towards improving it.</p>
<p>Writing a feedback is a very hard part for me. Because I don't want to judge a person in just small amout of time and we can't just say it was bad or good. Because you need time to judge the working environment.</p>
<p>Whenever I write feedback I want to keep in mind that wherever I see he or she was not good could it be more better if we had more time</p>
