    <h2><em>What is JavaScript Used For?</em></h2>
<p><h3>Properly constructed web pages are built using up to three different languages.<h3><p>
<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>
<h4>HTML</h4>
<p>The HTML defines what the content is. When written properly no attempt is made to define how that content is supposed to look. 
How it will look when used on different screens.</p>
<h4>CSS</h4>
<p>The appearance of a web page is defined using CSS which has the ability to specify which media the specific commands are to apply to so as to be able to have the content formatted appropriately for whatever device the page is being accessed with.</p>
<h4>Javascript</h4>
<h5>The purpose of JavaScript is to solve this problem</h5>
<p>It convert your static page into dynamic so that now user can interact with the page without waiting for the new page to load everytime he made changes.</p>
<p>JavaScript adds behaviour to the web page where the web page is capable of responding to actions by your visitors without needing to load a new web page in order to process their request</p>
