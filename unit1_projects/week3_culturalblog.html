      <h3> My thinking style</h3>
    </p>My personal thinking style is abstract which is correctly explaining me. 
I like healthy environment to work .
Some people think that working aone makes you perfect in every field.
But when I work I need someone to work through the problem it 
helps me to analyze my weeknesses and strength. 
</p>
<h3>Strength</h3>
<p>
I think with this mentality my positive point in DBC will be to
work wirh partners better which is important part of the proram and also
a chance to make friends along with friends which will not only
help you in working but also in your other problems like our fear and 
confidence.</p> 
<h3>Weeknesses</h3>
<p>
Along with strength always comes weeknesses too. My weekness will be 
as I think with this mentality will be to become dependent.
I will be losing the chance to have an individual assignment.
