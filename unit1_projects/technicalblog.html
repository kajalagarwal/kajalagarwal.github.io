<p style="color:black;"><b>Website I like</b></p>
<em style="color:green;">The three websites which I like are not very fancy but I liked them because of their simplicity and easiness. I think the very important part of any website would be its simplicity so that it can be reached to more number of peoples around. With a more complexity a website can look elegant but might loose its reachability.<br>
Three website which I like are as follows<br>
<b style="color:black;">Amazon.com:</b><br>
I like Amazon more because of its simplicity. If you are very new in internet world even then you can easily buy anything from here because of the images, easy words, categories and other features they have included in their website so that you don't need to be a very good world to operate it. You just need to click on the pictures and yeah here you go.<br>
I would describe it Simple, Elegant and Basic. This website basically solved the problem of how even using simpler and user friendly terms we can easily make the website look elegant.  The idea and purpose of the website is fantastic as now we don't have to depend on transportation and time. Even after a long time you can find a new stuff which does not let you get bored. <br>
<b style="color:black;">Gmail.com:</b><br>
Like everyone will accept Gmail is the most important website you will definitely be use to if you are or are not spending very long time on internet. Gmail has become the most efficient way of communication in internet world. Some of the best feature I like which Gmail include is spanning and differentiating important mails from others which make your world easier. I will conclude Gmail as elegant and sophisticated. You don't need to spend a long amount of time to find important mail here which makes it more efficient than others.<br>
<b style="color:black;">Facebook.com:</b><br>
For a social person facebook is like a boon. With its ample features it has become the most famous social site all around. You can easily share your pictures, comments, thoughts etc  with others and also like the other's. The feature which I like best in facebook is how it helps you search your friend with all the information you have like where he lives his profile photo and all other information the person has already shared on his profile and also the suggestion feature like if your friend's friend is not in your friend list it will suggest you to add them if you want to.  I find facebook.com very bold and Entertaining because it makes you feel that you are always connected to others.<br></em>
