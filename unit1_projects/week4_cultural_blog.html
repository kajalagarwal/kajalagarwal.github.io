<p>People today are getting so competitive that they are forgetting to live the life. If they are studying they want to graduate with high grades. If they have a high grade then need internship with a good company and if have internship then need full time. They think that once they have full time job they will be feeling stable but this is not the case.<br>
From my personal experience I know once you start working in industry you never feel stable you need more and more money and competition, it is like a adrenaline in your system which you can't slow down or say like a unquinchable thirst which no water can stop.<br>
For an example My own brother graduated from Stanford 5 year back. He is working in U.S as an Quality analyst Engineer from past 5 years and has switched 3 jobs till now still he is not satisfied or feel stable. He always says if he stays at one position for a long time he starts feeling bounded and bored because he needs new competition and challenges in life.
They ae so addicted to them that sometimes they forget that life is slipping from their hand.<br>
You have so many opportunities to take that you can't even guess which to grab and which to loose and in the last you end up standing in the middle of both. </p>
