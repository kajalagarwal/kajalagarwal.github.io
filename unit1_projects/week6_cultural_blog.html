    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>A stereotype is a fixed, over generalized belief about a particular group or class of people. <br>
    A widely held but fixed and oversimplified image or idea of a particular type of person or thing.<br>
    an often unfair and untrue belief that many people have about all people or things with a particular characteristic.
    <h3>Racial Stereotype</h3>
    <p>The most famous study of racial stereotyping was published by Katz and Braly in 1933 when they reported the results of a questionnaire completed by students at Princeton University in the USA.</p>
    <h4>Aim: </h4>To investigate stereotypical attitudes of Americans towards different races.

<h4>Method: </h4>Questionnaire method was used to investigate stereotypes. American university students were given a list of nationalities and ethic groups (e.g. Irish, Germans etc.), and a list of 84 personality traits. They were asked to pick out five or six traits which they thought were typical of each group.

<h4>Results: </h4>There was considerable agreement in the traits selected. White Americans, for example, were seen as industrious, progressive and ambitious. African Americans were seen as lazy, ignorant and musical. Participants were quite ready to rate ethnic groups with whom they had no personal contact.

<h4>Conclusion:</h4> Ethnic stereotypes are widespread, and shared by members of a particular social group.
